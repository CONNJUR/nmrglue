Items to do before article is published
=======================================

1. Check over examples, prune, update and add as needed.  Add links to raw 
data.  Add examples of spectral analysis (peak picking, lineshape fitting).
Add T1 measurements and TEDOR fitting?  Linear prediction, peak picking,
fitting and segmentation examples.

Find way to include t1_fitting data...

2. Rewrite tutorial, include mention of analysis module.

3. Release version 0.4 and write release instructions, check installer on 
Linux, Windows, and OS-X.  Update install script, grep for XXX in all files
and update pyPI record.



To Do and other updates post journal article.
=============================================

Idea list broken down by directory.

global
------
-Use CapCase for classes

nmrglue
-------

    filio
    -----
    - finish writing, documenting and testing rnmrtk module.
    - lowmemory (in-place) writing of regions of data.
        Use data_nd functionality with put_slice.
    - ability to write slices to file in all modules (ala pipe.write_slice3d)
    - global iter3D object
    - update glue module?
    - sparky_nd object? or dimension agnostic functions?
    - spinev module?
    - simpson module

    gui? 
    ----
    - gui module with common gui functions?

    process
    ------
    - test and document proc_lp module and lp/lpc/lp2d in pipe_proc module.
    - glue_proc module?
    - debug XXX in pipe_proc
    - more work on broken tests in test_pipe_proc
    - proc_mem module (Maximum Entropy)?
    - add missing functions in pipe_proc
    - FWHT in proc_base
    - profile processing and optimize
    - poly_td and poly_fd in proc_bl.py

test
----

-   The following modules do not have tests, decide how to test them and where
    such tests belong:

Module          Notes
------          ------
fileiobase      Tested       
glue            Not currently imported      
rnmrtk          
table       
proc_base       Partially tested with pipe_proc test     
proc_bl         Partially tested with pipe_proc test
proc_lp         Partially tested with pipe_proc test
analysisbase    No tests needed    
helpers         
leastsqbound    
lineshapes1d    
linesh          
peakpick        
segmentation    
misc

- Check coverage on current tests, get to 80%+
- Create unit tests?


doc
---

-   pipe_proc: Add References to low level function / better description
-   proc_base : Additional documentation, indication which functions work on 
    arbitrary dimensional data.
-   proc_bl : Flesh out the sol_* functions?
-   helpers : Better documentation, examples?
-   lineshapes1d : fix warning during build caused by missing __init__ methods, 
    add .. math:: in lineshape documentation?
-   peakpick : Add links to the picking algorithms.
-   segmentation : Add See Also sections?

Other thoughts
--------------
- Unix like commands (coadd_pipe, seperate_varian, ...)
- GUI to create conversions scripts

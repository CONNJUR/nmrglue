ftiing_t1_data example
======================

Introduction
------------

In this example T1 relaxation data is fit using a series of Python script which
use nmrglue to extract and fit the relaxation trajectories.

Instructions
------------

1. Run extract_trajs.py, which read box limits from boxes.in, a list of
spectra from spectra.in and intergrates each peak in each spectrum.  The
normalized trajecories are stored in the `traj.npy` file.

2. Run fit_exp_leastsq.py to fit the trajectories in the `traj.npy` file.  The
best fit parameter are stored to the `fits.pickle` file and the human readable
`fits.txt` file.  

3. Run the pt.py script which creates plots (XYY_plot.png) of the various
trajectories.

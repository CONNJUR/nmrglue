plotting example: plot_2d_assignments
=====================================

This example shows how to use nmrglue and 
`matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/index.html>`_ to create figures
for examining data or publication.  In this example the assignments used in
:ref:`integrate_2d` are graphically examined.  A contour plot of the spectrum
with the boxes and assignments is created.  To examine the box limit more
closely see :ref:`plot_2d_boxes`.
